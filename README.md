# Insta Handle Finder

Four tools in one side panel, switched with the tabs at the top:

| Mode | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Google handles** | Walks `site:instagram.com "<city>"` Google results and collects public profile handles. |
| **Instagram profiles** | Takes profile URLs/handles and exports each account's full profile + every post to `<handle>.json`. |
| **YouTube channels** | Takes channel URLs/@handles and exports each channel's full profile + every video to `<handle>.json`. |
| **LinkedIn posts** | Takes a LinkedIn search-results URL and exports every post the search returns to `linkedin-<keywords>.json`. |

They are independent — separate runs, separate tabs, separate saved state — so
the natural workflow is to find handles in the first mode and feed them into the
second.

## Setup

1. Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome.
2. Turn on **Developer mode** (top-right toggle).
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select this `extension` folder.
4. The extension icon (purple "IH") should appear in the toolbar. Pin it for
   easy access if you like.
5. Clicking the icon opens the extension as a **side panel** docked to the
   right of the browser window (not a dropdown popup) — it stays open and
   keeps its own state even as the tab next to it navigates from page to
   page, so it never reloads or loses progress mid-run.

Whenever you (or I) change any of the extension's files, come back to
`chrome://extensions` and click the reload icon (🔄) on the extension's card
to pick up the changes.

### Permissions it asks for, and why

Chrome shows these on the extension's card. Nothing here talks to a server that
isn't Google or Instagram — there is no backend, no telemetry, no account.

| Permission | Why it is needed |
|---|---|
| `tabs`, `scripting` | Open and drive the one working tab, and inject the scraper into it |
| `storage`, `unlimitedStorage` | Keep run state and collected posts across restarts; a 16k-post account exceeds the default 10 MB quota |
| `alarms` | Pace the run in a way that survives the service worker being shut down |
| `notifications` | Tell you when a run pauses and needs you |
| `sidePanel` | The UI itself |
| `downloads` | Save `<handle>.json` |
| `offscreen` | A service worker can't create a blob URL, so a hidden page does it |
| `https://www.google.com/*` | Mode 1 — read search results |
| `https://www.instagram.com/*`, `https://instagram.com/*`, `https://i.instagram.com/*` | Mode 2 — open the profile and read its data as your logged-in session |
| `https://www.youtube.com/*`, `https://youtube.com/*`, `https://m.youtube.com/*` | Mode 3 — open the channel and read its data as your logged-in session |
| `https://www.linkedin.com/*`, `https://linkedin.com/*` | Mode 4 — open the search and read the results as your logged-in session |

> After adding a new host permission, Chrome may show the extension as needing
> re-enabling on the `chrome://extensions` card the first time. Toggle it off and
> on if a mode does nothing at all.

## Mode 1 — Google handles

1. Click the toolbar icon to open the side panel.
2. **Cities** — type or paste city names, one per line. You can also paste a
   comma-separated list (`lucknow,kanpur,agra`) — it auto-converts to one
   city per line.
3. **Max pages / city** — how many Google result pages to walk per city
   (1–50). Each page is ~10 results. Default is `3`.
4. **Delay between pages (s)** — wait time between page loads (min 5,
   default `10`). Lower delay = faster but more likely to trigger a CAPTCHA.
5. Click **Start**. A new tab opens and starts walking through
   `site:instagram.com "<city>"` results, page by page, city by city.
6. Watch the **live status/log** in the side panel — current city, current page,
   and how many new handles were found on each page.
7. Click **Download JSON** any time (even mid-run) to save whatever has been
   collected so far.

### If a CAPTCHA/block shows up

- The run **pauses automatically** and you'll get a **desktop notification**
  ("Insta Handle Finder — Paused"). Clicking the notification brings the
  driven tab to the front.
- Solve the CAPTCHA yourself in that tab.
- Come back to the side panel and click **Resume** — it re-loads the same page it
  paused on and continues from there.
- The run only ever moves forward when you click Resume — there's no
  automatic retry.

### Reset

The **Reset** button clears the current run's results, log, and settings
back to defaults. It asks for confirmation first since this is not
reversible — **download your JSON before resetting** if you want to keep it.

### Output format

```json
{
  "generated_at": "2026-08-18T12:00:00.000Z",
  "query_template": "site:instagram.com \"<city>\"",
  "max_pages_per_city": 3,
  "delay_seconds": 10,
  "status": "done",
  "total_handles": 23,
  "cities": {
    "lucknow": [
      { "handle": "@nowlucknow", "profile_url": "https://www.instagram.com/nowlucknow/" }
    ],
    "kanpur": [ ... ]
  }
}
```

- Handles are deduped **globally** — if the same handle shows up for two
  different cities, it's only kept under whichever city found it first.
- Only URLs shaped like `instagram.com/<single-segment-handle>/` are kept —
  posts, reels, stories, explore, and similar non-profile links are filtered
  out.

### Good to know / limits

- **No early exit**: every city runs through its full "Max pages" setting,
  even if some pages turn up zero new handles. Deep page counts (30–50) can
  take a while — each page waits `delaySec` seconds, plus a longer pause
  when moving to the next city.
- **Nothing is evaded**: the extension uses your real logged-in browser tab
  as-is — no proxies, no spoofed headers, no hidden/parallel tabs, no
  CAPTCHA automation. This keeps it simple but means it's still subject to
  normal Google rate-limiting.
- **Progress survives side panel close**: closing the side panel doesn't stop
  the run; it keeps going in the driven tab. Reopen the panel any time to see
  where it's at.
- **Progress survives browser restart... partially**: if Chrome restarts
  mid-run, the run stops (status becomes "Stopped") but whatever was
  collected up to that point is preserved — just click Start again or
  Download.
- Closing the driven tab manually also stops the run (results are kept).

## Mode 2 — Instagram profiles (full profile + all posts)

Paste one or more **public Instagram profile URLs or handles** and it opens each
one in a tab, pulls the profile plus every post by paging to the end, and
downloads one JSON file per account named after the handle (`natgeo.json`).
With several accounts, the files arrive one by one as each account finishes.

### How to use it

1. Log into instagram.com in the same Chrome profile. These endpoints usually
   return `401` for a logged-out browser, so the run would just pause asking you
   to log in.
2. Switch the side panel to **Instagram profiles**.
3. **Accounts** — one per line. All of these work and mean the same thing:
   `https://www.instagram.com/natgeo/`, `www.instagram.com/natgeo`, `@natgeo`,
   `natgeo`, and URLs with tracking junk like `?igsh=...`. Post, reel, story,
   explore and `/tagged/` links are rejected — you'll be told how many lines were
   skipped before anything starts.
4. **Delay between pages** (default 3s, min 2) and **Delay between accounts**
   (default 8s, min 3). Lower = faster and more likely to hit a rate limit.
5. Click **Start**. Watch the live status: which account, which page, how many
   posts so far, and a running list of finished accounts.
6. Each account's file downloads automatically the moment it completes — the
   side panel does not have to stay open.

### When it pauses

Same posture as mode 1: **it pauses, it never evades and it never retries in a
loop.** You get a red `⏸` badge and a sticky desktop notification (click it to
jump to the tab). The panel tells you exactly what happened and what to do:

| What happened | What you do |
|---|---|
| Rate limit (429) | Wait — **Resume** is disabled with a live countdown, then enabled. Backoff doubles per consecutive hit, capped at 15 min. |
| Not logged in (401) | Log into Instagram in that tab, then **Resume**. |
| Blocked (403) / checkpoint | Clear it in the tab, then **Resume**. |
| Network dropped | Check your connection, then **Resume**. |
| Instagram changed its API | All post fallbacks failed — the extension needs updating. |
| No profile source worked | Every profile source failed (`profile_unavailable`). Check the driven tab: if the profile itself does not render there, it is a block rather than an API change. |
| Tab closed / browser restarted | **Resume** re-opens the tab and carries on. |

**Resume always continues from the saved cursor**, so nothing is re-downloaded
and nothing is lost. Two cases are handled without pausing at all: a **private**
account you don't follow gets a profile-only file and the run moves on, and a
**handle that doesn't exist** is simply skipped.

### Output format — `<handle>.json`

```json
{
  "handle": "natgeo",
  "profile_url": "https://www.instagram.com/natgeo/",
  "fetched_at": "2026-08-21T12:00:00.000Z",
  "source": "web_profile_info+feed_api",
  "complete": true,
  "incomplete_reason": null,
  "profile": {
    "user_id": "787132",
    "username": "natgeo",
    "full_name": "National Geographic",
    "biography": "...",
    "external_url": "http://natgeo.com",
    "is_private": false,
    "is_verified": true,

    "followers": 280000000,
    "following": 150,
    "posts_count": 30000,
    "profile_pic_url": "https://...",
    "profile_pic_url_hd": "https://..."
  },
  "posts_count_reported": 30000,
  "posts_collected": 30000,
  "posts": [
    {
      "id": "3123456789012345678",
      "shortcode": "C1a2b3c4d5",
      "url": "https://www.instagram.com/p/C1a2b3c4d5/",
      "taken_at": "2026-08-01T09:15:00.000Z",
      "media_type": "carousel",
      "is_video": false,
      "caption": "...",
      "like_count": 12345,
      "comment_count": 678,
      "view_count": null,
      "display_url": "https://...",
      "video_url": null,
      "carousel_media": [
        { "media_type": "image", "display_url": "https://...", "video_url": null }
      ],
      "location": { "name": "Delhi", "pk": "42" },
      "tagged_users": ["someone"]
    }
  ]
}
```

- **`complete`** is `true` only when the account was paged all the way to the
  end. Anything else sets it to `false` and fills in `incomplete_reason`
  (`private`, `capped`, `partial: rate_limit`, ...) — a partial file never
  pretends to be a full one.
- **`source`** records which endpoints produced the data, so you can tell a
  clean run from one that fell back.
- **Posts are deduped by id** when the file is assembled, so an overlapping page
  after a resume can never produce a duplicate.
- **`comment_count` is the number, not the comments.** Fetching the actual
  comment threads would mean one extra request per post (and those are paginated
  too) — hours of requests and a near-certain block.
- **Media URLs are links, not files.** Nothing is downloaded except the JSON.
  Note that Instagram's CDN URLs expire after a few days, so archive the media
  yourself if you need it long-term.

### Good to know / limits

- **Nothing is evaded.** It uses your own logged-in tab, your own cookies, no
  proxies, no spoofed headers, no parallel hidden tabs, no captcha solving.
  Heavy scraping on your own account can still earn you a rate limit or an
  action block — that's why the default delays are conservative.
- **Instagram's data endpoints are undocumented and change.** Both halves of the
  job fall back rather than fail:
  - *Profile* — `web_profile_info`, retried under each known web app id, then
    `users/<id>/info/` (the id comes from the page's own embedded JSON, or from
    the search endpoint), then the rendered page's `og:` tags. Whichever source
    answered is stamped on the saved profile as `profile_source`, and anything
    that source cannot supply stays `null` rather than being guessed.
  - *Posts* — the feed API, then GraphQL, then a DOM scroll harvest (which
    yields only shortcodes, tagged `"source": "dom"`).

  One known case this covers: Instagram's own serialiser answers
  `web_profile_info` with **HTTP 400 — "Asset
  asset://laser.provider/ig_business_category_subvertical has been deleted. You
  cannot use this schema"** for many business accounts. Nothing is blocked, one
  response shape is simply broken, so the run now moves to the next source
  instead of pausing. The endpoint constants live at the top of
  `content-ig-fetch.js` for easy updating.
- **Hard cap of 500 pages** (~16k posts) per account as a runaway guard. Hitting
  it is reported in the log and marks the file `complete: false` — it is never a
  silent truncation.
- **Progress survives a sleeping service worker.** The paging loop runs in the
  page itself, and every page is persisted, so an MV3 worker shutdown mid-crawl
  costs nothing.
- **Download partial** grabs whatever the current account has so far, at any
  point, without disturbing the run.
- **Reset** clears the Instagram run's collected data and stored pages. Files
  already downloaded are untouched.

## Mode 3 — YouTube channels (full profile + all videos)

Same shape as mode 2, pointed at YouTube. You give it channels, it gives you one
`<handle>.json` per channel containing the channel's profile and every video it
publishes — regular uploads and past live streams. Shorts are deliberately skipped.

### How to use it

1. Log into YouTube in this Chrome profile (not strictly required for public
   channels, but a logged-out session hits walls sooner).
2. Open the side panel, switch to the **YouTube channels** tab.
3. Paste channels, one per line. All of these work:

   ```
   https://www.youtube.com/@mkbhd
   https://www.youtube.com/@mkbhd/videos
   @NASA
   mkbhd
   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBJycsmduvYEL83R_U4JriQ
   https://www.youtube.com/c/SomeOldChannel
   https://www.youtube.com/user/SomeOldUser
   ```

   Video, Shorts-video, playlist and search links are **rejected** — the panel
   tells you how many lines it skipped before it starts.
4. Set the delays. Defaults are 3 s between listing pages, 8 s between channels,
   700 ms between videos.
5. **Full video details** (on by default) is the important switch — see below.
6. **Start**. A tab opens on the first channel and works through it.

### The details switch

The channel listing only carries cheap fields: url, title, thumbnail, a rounded
view count ("1.2M views"), duration and "2 days ago". **Like count, comment
count, exact view count and the full description do not exist in the listing** —
each one needs its own request per video.

| Details | What you get | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| **On** (default) | Every field, exact view counts, full description | ~1 request per video — a 1,000-video channel takes roughly 20 minutes |
| **Off** | url, title, thumbnail, approximate views, duration, published-ago | One request per ~30 videos — minutes for the same channel |

With details off, `like_count`, `comment_count` and `description` are `null` and
`details_source` is `null`, so a thin file is always self-describing rather than
looking like a channel with zero likes.

### When it pauses

Same stance as the other modes: every wall becomes a resumable pause with a
notification, never a silent failure and never a retry storm.

| Reason | What to do |
|---|---|
| `login_wall` | Log into YouTube in that tab, then **Resume** |
| `consent_wall` | Accept YouTube's cookie consent in that tab, then **Resume** |
| `bot_check` | YouTube asked you to confirm you're not a bot — clear it in the tab, then **Resume** (cool-down applies) |
| `rate_limit` | Wait out the cool-down on the Resume button, then **Resume** |
| `forbidden` / `network` | Wait a bit, check the connection, **Resume** |
| `endpoint_shape` | YouTube changed its layout — see Troubleshooting |

Resume picks up from the exact continuation token and the exact channel tab it
was inside, so nothing is re-crawled. A channel that does not exist is skipped
rather than pausing the whole queue.

### Output format — `<handle>.json`

Deliberately the same envelope as mode 2, with `videos` where that one has
`posts`:

```json

  "handle": "@mkbhd",

      "duration_text": "12:34",
      "duration_seconds": 754,
      "is_live_now": false,
      "live_viewers": null,
      "details_source": "next",
      "details_error": null
    }
  ]
}
```

- **`kind`** is `video` or `live` — the Videos and Live tabs are crawled in that order
  into one list, deduped by id (a past stream can appear in both). **Shorts are not
  collected at all** — the Shorts tab is never requested, and a Shorts shelf appearing
  inside another tab is skipped rather than mapped.
- **`videos_count_reported` is YouTube's own channel total**, which counts Shorts. Since
  Shorts are not collected, `videos_collected` is normally lower — that gap is expected
  and does not make the file incomplete.
- **`comment_count` is a plain number** (or `null` if comments are off/unreadable). No
  comment text, authors or threads are fetched — only the count YouTube itself displays.
- **`view_count_exact`** tells you whether the number is YouTube's exact figure
  or its rounded "1.2M". With details on it is exact; with details off it is not.
- **`details_source`** is `next` (or `next+player`) for an enriched video and
  `null` for one that was never enriched; `details_error` says why a single
  video could not be read (removed, private, age-gated) without failing the run.
- **`subscriber_count`** is parsed from YouTube's own rounded text — YouTube
  itself does not publish an exact subscriber number any more, hence
  `subscriber_count_exact: false`.
- **A stream that is live right now** reports watchers, not views, in the same field —
  those land in `live_viewers` with `is_live_now: true`, and `view_count` stays null
  rather than being quietly understated.
- **A count YouTube writes in a form the parser cannot trust becomes `null`**, never a
  guess; the raw string is always kept alongside in the matching `*_text` field.
- **Thumbnail URLs are links, not files.** Nothing is downloaded except the JSON.

### Good to know / limits

- **Nothing is evaded.** It calls YouTube's own InnerTube endpoints from your own
  logged-in tab with the page's own client identity — no proxies, no spoofed
  user-agent, no hidden parallel tabs, no bot-check solving.
- **Requests ask for English labels** (`hl=en`, region left alone). Every count YouTube
  ships is a *string*, and separator rules differ per language — a German
  "1,2 Mio. Aufrufe" cannot be read without guessing. The channel profile is fetched
  through that same English request rather than scraped off the rendered page.
- **The InnerTube API is undocumented and changes.** Every field is located by
  key rather than by a fixed path, so a renamed wrapper does not break the crawl;
  a renamed *field* becomes `null` rather than a crash. The endpoint constants
  and channel-tab `params` live at the top of `content-yt-fetch.js`.
- **Hard cap of 500 pages** (~15k videos) per channel as a runaway guard, same as
  mode 2 — reported in the log and marked `complete: false`.
- **Progress survives a sleeping service worker.** The paging loop runs in the
  page itself and every page is persisted.
- **Download partial** and **Reset** behave exactly as in mode 2.

## Mode 4 — LinkedIn posts (from a search URL)

You give it a LinkedIn **search results** URL; it scrolls the result list to the end and
writes every post it saw to one `linkedin-<keywords>.json`.

### How to use it

1. Log into LinkedIn in this Chrome profile.
2. Search on LinkedIn, then click the **Posts** tab, and copy the URL from the address bar.
   It looks like:

   ```
   https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=ai%20startup
   ```

   Any filters you set on that page (date posted, sort order, author) are part of the URL,
   so whatever the page shows is what gets exported.
3. Open the side panel, switch to the **LinkedIn posts** tab, and paste the URL — one per
   line if you want several searches in a row.

   Also accepted: `/search/results/all/?keywords=…` (rewritten to the Posts tab, since
   the "all" tab only ever shows a few posts) and hashtag feeds like
   `/feed/hashtag/saas`. Profile, job-search and single-post links are **rejected** — the
   panel tells you how many lines it skipped before it starts.
4. Set the limits. Defaults are 3 s between scrolls, 10 s between searches, and **300 posts
   per search** (set it to `0` for no limit).
5. **Start**. A tab opens on the search and scrolls until LinkedIn stops adding results.

### How it reads the page

Unlike modes 2 and 3, this one reads the **rendered page** rather than a private JSON API.
That is deliberate: LinkedIn's internal endpoints are gated behind ids that rotate
constantly, while search results are an infinite scroll — scrolling is the native way to
page through them, and the DOM is what you are already looking at.

Posts are located three ways, in order, so a redesign has to break all four to stop the
run:

1. **By activity id** — every element whose attributes or link `href` carry a post id, in
   either spelling LinkedIn uses: `urn:li:activity:123…` and the `…-activity-123…-AbCd`
   segment inside a `/posts/` permalink. This runs first because it is the only method that
   can see nesting: when a reshare's quoted post has an id and the outer card does not, a
   plain selector would return the quoted post.
2. **By selector** — the known wrapper class names, for speed on a familiar layout.
3. **By structure** — the smallest element holding both an author block and a post body.
4. **By repeated siblings** — the element whose children are all post-shaped, taken as the
   result list. This needs no class name, no id and no attribute, and is what carries the
   run on builds where LinkedIn ships hashed class names like `_8f294d25`.

If all four come back empty, the run reports `no posts found` and the log dumps the shape
of the results list (its class, its child count, the child's `data-` attributes, and whether
a urn appears in the HTML at all) — which is what the next one-line fix is made from.

Two consequences worth knowing:

- **Truncated posts are expanded first.** LinkedIn only renders the first ~200 characters
  until "…see more" is clicked, so each round clicks those open before reading, and `text`
  is the full post rather than a preview.
- **A reshare is one row, not two.** The quoted post nested inside it is skipped, and the
  outer post is flagged `is_repost: true`.

### When it pauses

Same stance as every other mode: each wall becomes a resumable pause with a notification.

| Reason | What to do |
|---|---|
| `login_wall` | Log into LinkedIn in that tab, then **Resume** |
| `challenge` | Clear LinkedIn's verification in that tab, then **Resume** |
| `rate_limit` | LinkedIn's search limit. The cool-down starts at 5 minutes and doubles up to an hour — wait it out, then **Resume** |
| `wrong_origin` | LinkedIn bounced the tab elsewhere; **Resume** re-opens the search |

Resume re-opens the search and skips everything already banked, so a resumed pass only
adds what it did not already have.

### Output format — `linkedin-<keywords>.json`

```json

  "search_label": "creator requirements",
  "search_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/content/?keywords=creator%20requirements",

- **`discription`** is the line LinkedIn shows directly under the author's name — their
  profile headline. (Spelled as requested; renaming it to `description` is a one-line
  change in `slimPost()`.)
- **`author.type`** is `person`, `company` or `school`, taken from the profile URL.
- **`text` keeps its line breaks.** Truncated posts are expanded before reading, so this
  is the whole post and not the "…see more" preview.
- **Anything unreadable is `null`, never guessed.** A headline is never borrowed from a
  neighbouring card, and a card with no headline gets `null`.
- **The scraper collects more than it exports.** Post ids, reaction/comment counts, media
  URLs and permalinks are gathered and used internally — the id in particular is what
  dedupes a post across scrolls and resumes — but the file stays narrow on purpose.
  `slimPost()` in `background-linkedin.js` is the single place that decides the shape;
  widening it back is one line per field.

### Good to know / limits

- **Nothing is evaded.** It scrolls the user's own logged-in tab, exactly as a person
  would. No proxies, no spoofed user-agent, no hidden tabs, no auth-wall bypass.
- **LinkedIn caps search results.** A content search stops producing new results well
  before the total it claims; the run ends when scrolling stops adding posts, which is the
  real end of what LinkedIn will serve.
- **LinkedIn's terms restrict automated collection**, and posts are personal data — keep
  the exports to what you actually need, and to what you are allowed to hold.
- **Markup changes are visible, not silent.** If a redesign defeats all four strategies,
  the run reports `no_results` with the shape of the page, and the fix is one entry in
  `POST_SELECTORS` at the top of `content-li-fetch.js`.
- **A post with no urn is still exported**, with a content-derived `id` so it still dedupes.
  Losing a permalink beats losing the post.

## Troubleshooting

**Where to look first.** `chrome://extensions` → the extension's card →
**Service worker** → *Inspect*. That console is where all four background scripts
log. The side panel's own log (last 20 events) is the quicker read for
"what just happened".

| Symptom | What it usually means |
|---|---|
| Mode 2 does nothing, no tab opens | Every line you pasted was rejected. The log says how many were skipped — check for post/reel links. |
| Pauses immediately with `401` | Not logged into instagram.com in this Chrome profile. |
| Pauses on the first page with "API badli" | Instagram changed its endpoints — see below. |
| The page never scrolls | **Expected.** Mode 2 calls Instagram's JSON endpoints directly instead of scrolling. Scrolling only happens in the last-resort DOM fallback. |
| File downloaded but `posts` is short | Check `complete` and `incomplete_reason` in the JSON — it will say `capped`, `private`, or which pause stopped it. |
| Mode 3 is very slow | Expected with details on — one extra request per video. Turn the details checkbox off for a listing-only run, or lower the per-video delay. |
| Mode 3 videos have `null` likes/comments | Either details were off, or that video's `details_error` says why (removed, private, age-gated). |
| Mode 3 pauses with "consent page" | YouTube showed its cookie consent interstitial. Accept it in that tab, then Resume. |
| Mode 3 file has an empty `videos` list | It will say `complete: false` with `no videos found`. Check the side panel log — it names the renderer YouTube actually sent (e.g. `lockupViewModel x30`), which is the one line to add to `VIDEO_KEYS`. |
| Mode 4 stops after a few dozen posts | Usually the `Max posts` limit (default 300) or LinkedIn simply not serving more for that search. Check `posts_collected` vs the limit. |
| Mode 4 posts all end in "…see more" | The see-more buttons did not get clicked — report it; the selector list is `SEE_MORE_SELECTORS` in `content-li-fetch.js`. |
| Mode 4 file has an empty `posts` list | It says `complete: false` with `no posts found`. The log names the selectors that were on the page — that is the one line to fix in `POST_SELECTORS`. |

**If Instagram changes its API.** These endpoints are undocumented and rotate.
When every fallback fails, find the current one yourself:

1. Open a profile in a normal tab with DevTools → **Network** → filter `XHR`.
2. Scroll the post grid. The request that returns the next batch of posts is the
   one to copy — note its path and its request headers.
3. Update the constants at the top of `content-ig-fetch.js`
   (`PROFILE_PATH`, `USER_INFO_PATH`, `TOPSEARCH_PATH`, `FEED_PATH`,
   `GRAPHQL_HASHES`, `FALLBACK_APP_ID`, `LEGACY_APP_ID`) and reload the
   extension.

They are deliberately kept together at the top of that file so this stays a
one-line fix rather than a rewrite.

**If YouTube changes its layout.** Mode 3 looks every field up *by key* rather
than by a fixed path, so a renamed wrapper is survivable and a renamed field
degrades to `null` instead of crashing. When something genuinely breaks:

1. Open a channel's Videos tab with DevTools → **Network** → filter `Fetch/XHR`.
2. Scroll the grid. The `/youtubei/v1/browse` request that returns the next batch
   is the one to compare against — check its `params` (the channel-tab constant)
   and the renderer key the videos arrive under.
3. Update `CHANNEL_TABS` / `VIDEO_KEYS` at the top of `content-yt-fetch.js`, or the
   key names in `extractLikeCount` / `extractCommentCount` / `extractDescription`
   for a details-pass break, and reload the extension.

You usually will not need step 1 and 2: when a tab yields nothing, the log already names
the item renderers that were in the response, and a run that collected nothing is marked
`complete: false` rather than quietly succeeding.

Both of YouTube's current channel layouts are handled — the older `videoRenderer` grid
with a `c4TabbedHeaderRenderer`, and the newer `lockupViewModel` grid with a
`pageHeaderRenderer` whose counts are plain display strings. Channel facts that only the
About panel holds (joined date, country, links) are fetched with a dedicated request when
the channel page does not carry them.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `manifest.json` | Extension config, permissions, icons |
| `background.js` | Service worker — orchestrates the city × page loop, drives the tab |
| `content-scraper.js` | Injected into the Google results tab — scrapes handles, detects CAPTCHA/block |
| `background-profiles.js` | Service worker — orchestrates the Instagram account queue, persists pages, writes the files |
| `content-ig-fetch.js` | Injected into the Instagram tab — fetches the profile and pages through every post |
| `background-youtube.js` | Service worker — orchestrates the YouTube channel queue, persists pages, writes the files |
| `content-yt-fetch.js` | Injected into the YouTube tab — reads the channel profile and pages through every video |
| `background-linkedin.js` | Service worker — orchestrates the LinkedIn search queue, persists batches, writes the files |
| `content-li-fetch.js` | Injected into the LinkedIn tab — scrolls the search results and reads every post off the page |
| `offscreen.html` / `offscreen.js` | Turns the collected JSON into a downloadable blob URL (a service worker can't) |
| `popup/` | The side panel UI (HTML/CSS/JS), loaded via `side_panel.default_path` |
| `icons/` | Toolbar/notification icons |
